      <h4>My SMART Goal</h4>
      <p2>
          My SMART Goal is to write a good thesis statement. I will know that I have almost reached my goal when I earn over a 90% on an essay. I will work towards my goal by drafting and revising my thesis statement until I have one that best fits my essay.
      </p2>
      
      <h4> My Stretch</h4>
      <p2> I struggle with adapting to new situations, specifically working with new people that I haven't worked with before. I have improved on my stretch over the course of this sememster. I was put in groups that I haven't been in before and learned to adapt to the work ethic of the group. Example: I learned to adapt to working with Carter and Adam while making posters for History. </p2>
      <h4>My Strength</h4>
<p2>
    I can easily convey a point or idea through storytelling, imagery, and poetry. My writing ability has improved throughout the trimester. I used my strength during the Scarlet Letter essay, which I got 100% on.

  <h4>JCoSD</h4>

    <p2>JCoSD has shaped who I am as a person in many ways. I would not be as good at public speaking and handling social issues had my parents not founded this temple. JCo has also played a large part in developing my leadership skills and love for children, through assisting the youth director during events and camps, as well as babysitting during Shabbat services or potlucks. Youth group has also helped me be more social and open with my friends and fellow youth. I have met many life long friends at JCo that I am growing up with, and a safe community to have when life gets rough.</p2>

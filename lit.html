        <p2> This is my Scarlet Letter poem assignment. I got a 90% on it. It is evidence of my strength, and how I can write poems without rhyming, and still get a good grade. I normally write poems that rhyme, so I stepped out of my comfort zone and still did the best that I could do. It is evidence of me improving on my stretch, and adapting to something new and challenging. </p2>

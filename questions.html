       <h4>Reflection Questions and Responses</h4>
      <ol>
          <p3><li> How broad is your friend group? Are peers easily accepted (within your group and/or outside of your group)? What have you done/can you do to improve the social atmosphere within your group of friends, grade-level, or school?</li> </p3>
          <p4>I’m friends with most of the girls in the grade and some of the boys, but I usually only hang out with a specific group. I personally accept anyone who wants to come into my friend group, though normally nobody joins us. I try to improve my social atmosphere by spending time with other people I don’t normally hang out with, so I can build up all of my relationships and have a good atmosphere at school. </p4>
          <p3><li> How have you contributed to our community this year? Provide examples of any leadership roles you have assumed or how you have been a role model (these examples can be academic, social, or from extracurricular activities). How have you grown as a leader/role model, or what are some ideas on how to assume these roles in the future?</li> </p3>
          <p4> I took a leadership role in Social Studies when we were talking about the Declaration of Independence. We were put in groups and I made sure my group stayed on track. I have been a role model during theatre productions outside of school. The productions have a lot of younger kids who I help with lines, blocking, and just hang out with and make sure they are having fun. I have grown as a role model and leader during extracurricular activities because I help out when others are struggling and set a good example for the younger kids, whether in Youth Group, dance class, or theatre. </p4>
          <p3><li>Are you consistent with completing work on time? What is hindering/helping you?</li></p3>
          <p4>I am not the best at staying on track. I have a busy schedule everyday, and most days I am not home and doing homework until after 7 p.m. I have made it easier to get my work done every night by having a set time to start working so I'm not up to late.</p4>
